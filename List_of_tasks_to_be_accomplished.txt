List of tasks that need to accomplished (projects):
1) Issue: Bomb cannot reduce the no. of lives 
2) Colors for the no. of lives text:
if (lives === 3)
  {
    fill("limegreen");
  }
  else if (lives === 2)
  {
    fill("yellow");
  }
  else if (lives === 1)
  {
    fill("orange");
  }
  else if (lives === 0)
  {
    fill("red");
  }
3) Add gamestate, define losing and winning condition and start and end (game over) screens to be defined.
4) Winning condition: If score exceeds 500 or 1000 (maybe increased or changed as infinite)
5) Losing condition: If score is less than 0 or lives = 0.
Extras:
6) Issue: Very huge sprite hitboxes
7) Issue: If one sprite is touched, rest of the sprites (of same type) are automatically removed.
